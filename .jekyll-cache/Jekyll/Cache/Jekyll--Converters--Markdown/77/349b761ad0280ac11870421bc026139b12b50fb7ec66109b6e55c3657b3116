I"¨<p>We all remember the vengeful spirit of Taylor Swift. From claiming that â€œthereâ€™s nothing I do better than revengeâ€ to â€œbandaids donâ€™t fix bullet holes,â€ a certain part of her discography was dedicated to feuds and lost loves. Just two years ago, Taylor can be seen burning bridges and throwing shades, (in addition to being <em>presumably dead</em>) in the music video for â€œLook What You Made Me Do.â€</p>
